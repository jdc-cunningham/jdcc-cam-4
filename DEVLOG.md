Oh man I'm feeling it now Mr. Krabs, the juice is flowing

I thought I was working today, dumb...

Today I'll interface with the Waveshare display, I ordered another RPi HQ Cam and Pi 4B from Adafruit but still waiting for that.

I'll use the other Pi 4 I have currently.

Working on interfacing with the 2.8" waveshare DSI display, first try was a failure lol

Trying to add dtoverlay from this thread [https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=366011]

I feel like I'm being bad by not following through with my projects. I was supposed to design the dead space 3 scavenger robot and make it/paint it but I didn't get around to it.

I kind of lost the drive after a while. I will complete it at some point, I'm feeling interest in making this camera instead though even though outside it's winter so everything is brown and dead here in the midwest.

I started buying a bunch of parts, I'm looking at wide angle lenses next to try.

I'm also looking into tuning the camera for the Minolta 50mm F1.7

Did a base design, ordered the sea-green filament

I guess I didn't have to buy 3 different brands of these adapters oh well.

Also seems like most of the single-digit focal length lenses are fish eye.

So I'm not sure, I don't want that skewing/warping problem.

10:10 PM

I design the cameras inside-out, I start by modeling the parts and then fit them inside a shell.

Of course here I have a design I want in mind but yeah.

This is what happens though when you use off-the-shelf parts.

11:58 PM

I think I have almost all of the parts to build this camera already. I do have to wait for the OLED now that I decided to add.

I'll need to model all the parts and get the other adapters to check their dimensions, make sure they fit.
